## Delete all comments (only bot's messages) from a program
```javascript
fetchTTs(programID, function(data){
    let keys = []
    for(let i of data.feedback){
    keys.push(i.key)
    }
    for(let j of keys){
        deleteTipThanks(j, programID)
    }
})
```

# Ideas
1. Fetches a random post from Dev.to and posts it as a tutorial every week on Khan.
2. Lists a weekly "newspaper" of top projects, etc.
3. Update a program containing popular stock/crypto prices that can be accessed via the API by other KA programs. Or weather data in major cities.
4. Recreate codewars but users submit their solutions through the Tips&Thanks
5. Implement proxy for major APIs. (Like how Squishy did his multiplayer stuff)
